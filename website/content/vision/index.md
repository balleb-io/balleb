# What's up?

Soft-cores exist since the 70's. They are not very explored out of academy and projects with stiff requisits of performance
latency and energetic efficiency. The ocean is deep, but the market still shallow. The necessity of skilled labor and inovative developing tools urges, and here we are!

FPGAs are here to accelerate a ton of nowadays workloads. We are making this easy.

**Every Soc will have programmable silicon**

## What is Balleb
We develop soft-cores and deliver services.

We attend your specific needs with specific purpose hardware. Don't worry about the difficult and boring development, we handle that. 

## Gut Feelings
Maybe we are wrong, but...
1. FPGAs will never be so easy as CPUs. But it doesn't means that can't be better.
1. People are trying to sell the shovels instead of mining the gold. For Now!


## In the End

Our computing capacity will not grow as it grew in Moore's law. So if you want performance without spending thousands in energy consumption with GPU's, you have to surrender to soft-cores. Here we are!

Again, don't be afraid, see your problem backwards. If the it is in the end, you can't solve it by the beginning.
