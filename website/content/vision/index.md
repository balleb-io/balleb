# Whatâ€™s Up?
Soft processors have been around since the 1970s. However, they remain relatively unexplored outside of academic circles and projects with stringent requirements for performance, latency, and energy efficiency. The ocean is deep, but the market remains shallow. The demand for skilled labor and innovative development tools is pressing, and thatâ€™s where we come in!

FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) are here to turbocharge a multitude of modern workloads. Weâ€™re simplifying the process.

*Every SoC (System on Chip) will feature hardware you can describe.*

## What is Balleb?
At Balleb, we specialize in developing soft cores and providing tailored services.

We address your specific needs with purpose-built hardware. No need to fret about complex and tedious developmentâ€”weâ€™ve got that covered.

## Our vision 
Perhaps weâ€™re not entirely right, butâ€¦

- FPGAs will never be as straightforward as CPUs. However, that doesnâ€™t mean they canâ€™t be better than now.
- Instead of mining gold, folks are too busy selling shovels! For now. If FPGAs are underutilized by the market, you don't solve that by making developer tools! You solve that by writing applications.

## In the End
Our computing capacity wonâ€™t expand at the same rate as Mooreâ€™s Law. So, if you seek performance without draining your wallet on GPU energy consumption, soft cores are the answer. Here we are!

Plus, GPUs wonâ€™t cut it for edge computing. If youâ€™re aiming to accelerate embedded AI workloads that require low latency and low energy consumption, weâ€™ve got you covered.
