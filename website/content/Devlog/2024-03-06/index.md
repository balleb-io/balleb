## Brief Context:

We forked the **Zynet** repository into our own, giving birth to **Balleb**.

However, as things rarely go as planned, **Zynet** didn't function as expected. The reasons remained elusive.

The website was initially created as a placeholder, devoid of any content.

## Our Current Progress:

Over the past weeks, Pedro invested tremendous effort in fixing the **Zynet** compilation (from Python to Verilog). Now, we have a functional workflow prototype for developing soft cores for AI, at least with respect to the **MNIST** dataset. With this prototype we are able to generate IP Cores from a high-level neural network description. The idea is o integrate these IP Croes into embedded applications that use an FPGA, making it easier to develop AI applications for the edge. 

Additionally, we've updated the website, adding relevant content, and we're planning to post more frequently.

## Log:

Yesterday, I implemented an expansion for **Altera** devices, since ZyNet only supported Xilinx FPGAs. It appears to be working, but we still need to address the top-level that brings all our modules together.

Today, I wokred on our website, translated it to english, and successfully migrated our monorepo to our new organization on GitHub. Currently, I'm working on the **DevOps** side of things.
