## Brief context: 

We forked zynet repository into ours. This was the birth of balleb. 

But, as things do not work as planned, zynet did not work. We didn't know why. 

The website was created as a placeholder, but with no content. 

 

## Where we are by now: 

Pedro, past weeks, with tremendous effort fixed zynet compilation (python to verilog). Now we have a working workflow for developing soft cores for AI, at least works with mnist. 

The website has been updated, now we have content and planning to post with frequency. 

 

## Log: 

Yesterday I implemented an expansion for altera devices. It seems to work, but we need to fix the top-level program that reunites every file.  

Today I fixed the website and migrated the repository to the new organisation in github, and I am organising the devops session.
